# real3d-visualisation
An experimental responsive site for a hypothetical 3d visualisation company

Technologies: HTML, CSS; <br>
Duration: 3 hours

This is a project i gave myself in order to practice my responsive layout skills. The purpose was to create a layout with various sections of content and make it scale nicely on whatever device being viewed on.

This was achieved using media queries at different breakpoints. All assets are my own and the information is only hypothetical for demonstration purposes.

As i learn more about responsive design ill go back and refactor my code as well as add more examples.
